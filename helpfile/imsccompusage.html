Hi,

            don't try to use imsc2, use always

imsc1                 (Solaris)
imsc3                 (Solaris)
imsc10               (Linux)
imsc11               (Mac)
imsc12               (Linux)

to use gcc and g++
for solaris machine you have to add

/opt/csw/bin as you executable path

for that
if you are using bash  shell
 do the following command

export PATH=$PATH:/opt/csw/bin

if you are using tcsh shell

do the following command

setenv PATH ${PATH}:/opt/csw/bin




to know which shell you are using try echo $SHELL

Dear User,

The SMP type compute server is ready for use.
The details are as follows:

         System Name: imsc9
         O/S           : x86_64 GNU/Linux
         H/W           : 4xIntel Xeon E6540 6Core Processors
         Memory           : 96GB DDR3 1066MHz ECC RAM
         MotherBoard: SuperMicro X8QBE, Intel 7500chipset
         Disk           : 4x1TB SATA disk
         Cabinet           : 4U Rack Mountable
         Compilers  : All GNU compilers
         Performance: HighPerformanceLinpack Peak 172GigaFLOPS

This 4-Way 24-Cores Compute-Server system can be used
for your sequential computational jobs.

The interested users can login to the system(imsc9) and
change directory to /compute/imsc9/your-username so
that your work area is created. We advice the compute-users
to use the /compute/imsc9/your-username area for
your computational jobs and 'not the default home area'
