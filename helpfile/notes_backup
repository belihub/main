To keep a program running while logged out, say out of a remote terminal:

Just type “screen -R -D” and then start working as you normally would. When you’re ready to quit, you can detach with “Control-A D”. Screen keeps running. When you log in again later, you can type “screen -R -D” and re-attach to the screen session

--------------------------------------------
for using your own header files, for example a 

for running C code with math functions, do:

gcc -lm filename.c

for running C code using the graphics package SVGAlib, do:

gcc -O3 filename.c -lvga

To compile, execute and produce a beep:

gcc -lm glacierscaled.c; ./a.out; aplay /usr/share/sounds/phone.wav

to run filename.c with the c debugger gdb, do:

gcc -g filename.c

gdb a.out

you will get the command prompt:

(gdb)

now to insert a breakpoint at line 15 do:

b 15

and run the program by typing:

r

print the current value of any variablename by typing:

p variablename

continue with the program execution by typing:

c

quit by typing:

q

--------------------------------------------

Do:

ssh -fND 6060 belliappa@as2

restart firefox.

--------------------------------------------

copying files between comps:

Goto Places -> Connect to server -> choose option SSH -> type belliappa@as2

push:
ssh target_address cat <localfile ">" remotefile

pull:
ssh target_address cat remotefile > localfile


OR

push: 
scp filename me@remotehost:~/dirname
<to copy all files in local subdir to dir in remotehost:>
scp -r subdirname/* me@remotehost:~/dirname

pull:
scp "me@remotehost:~/dirname/filename" ./

eg. pull:
ssh belliappa@ncsc0 cat g5.dat > Glacier/g5.dat
scp "shankar@people:~/public_html/Welcome.html" ./

eg.push:
scp -r shankar/assignments/* shankar@people:~/public_html/assignments

Gnuplot: 

To fit a graph: eg.

> gnuplot

$p 'energy3' every ::1::50 u 1:3 notitle

$f(x) = a*x**4 + b*x**3 + c*x**2 + d*x + e

$fit f(x) 'energy3' every ::1::50 u 1:3 via a,b,c,d,e

$rep f(x) title "-75.03T^4 + 823.173T^3 -1388.05T^2 + 878.37T - 158.794"

to plot into a file: eg.

$ gnuplot ablation.gnu > ablation.png

for code completion, install rlwrap and say

$ rlwrap -a -c gnuplot

as above, for compiling, executing and plotting in one line:

gcc -lm glacier.c; ./a.out; echo 'plot "g1.dat" using 1:3' | gnuplot -persist

proxy stuff:

i got wget (used in installing msttcorefonts, installing firefox through ubuntuzilla and anything else that uses wget) working by substituting, in /etc/wgetrc, 
>#use_proxy = on 
with 
>use_proxy = off

to enable other non-socks-enabled programs to use socks proxy, install tsocks:

suo apt-get install tsocks

then delete everything in /etc/tsocks.conf except for
>server = 127.0.0.1
>server_type = 5
>server_port = 6060

then, after SSH -D'ing, run in a terminal, for example, 

>sudo tsocks apt-get update 

instead of

>sudo apt-get update 

--------------------------------------------

terminal commands:

software sources:
software-properties-gtk

synaptic:

update manager:

hardware drivers:

IDLE 3:
idle3 -n

to see running processes in a sortable listing with text graphs of CPU and memory usage, do:

>htop

if you want killing of root processes enabled, do:

>sudo htop

Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?

Diablo LOD:

Improved GFX (REMEMBER THIS)
by HoodedMan on Sunday August 3rd 2008, 10:00
To get higher resolutions and somewhat better GFX you can download the Glide3 to OpenGL wrapper at www.svenswrapper.de/english/index.html

Unzip the download and move the dll and exe into the Diablo 2 directory.
Now run the executeable "D2VidTst.exe" which runs the video test again. Because of the wrapper, you can now use the glide-renderer -- do this!

Now you can configure the glide wrapper through "glide-init.exe".

For me, Diablo 2 fullscreen did not work until I got this, ran glide-init.exe and selected "Desktop resolution" under "Settings".

This means that the game will take your native resolution, so if you run 1280x1050 then Diablo2 will run in 1280x1050 glory :P

If you have a widescreen, like 1280x800, 1440x900, 1680x1050, 1920x1200 or otherwise, Diablo 2 will run with the maximum 4:3 window it can fit inside of that widescreen, meaning you'll have some black bars on either side.

But the higher resolution is still there so you have a much better view of the game world. It's absolutely awesome ! :)

starting ET with bots enabled:

./et + set fs_game omnibot

ading bots in the console:

shift+tilde to get console

/bot addbot 1 2 through 5 to add to axis
/bot addbot 2 2 through 5 to add to allies

------------------------------------------

To see the sources file of Ubuntu:

gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

to see and _edit_ it:

sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

adding a gpg key: if for example the line added in sources.list looks like this,

deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/c-korn/ubuntu hardy main

then type this in the browser's address bar:

https://launchpad.net/~c-korn/+archive

then,

choose your distro version from the dropdown list

This repository is signed with <CLICK HERE> OpenPGP key blah blah

click there, save the key in a new text file in your home folder, open Adminstration > Software Sources, go to the Authentication tab, click Import Key File, select the text file you saved and click Add.

you're done.

short quotes:

Often it is the means that justify the ends: Goals advance technique and technique survives even when goal structures crumble. 

When we write programs that "learn", it turns out that we do and they don't. 

We are on the verge: Today our program proved Fermat's next-to-last theorem. 

One can't proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.
